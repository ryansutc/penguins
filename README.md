PROG1400 Assign 4: Penguins Tracking Form (Polymorphism, Regular Expressions, File IO, MVC style programming examples)

This is a somewhat contrived project to show examples of basic polymorphism, regular expressions, file input/output to a textfile using a buffered stream, dynamic arraylists, and basic MVC programming principles.

This version revised to allow for multiple GPS points for each animal. The GUI has also been rejigged.
